# LFQA
Reflective Long Format Question Answering Model with Continuous Feedback-Driven Improvement

## Overview
This project implements a long-form question answering (LFQA) system using the Facebook BART-base model. It is designed to generate comprehensive, well-structured answers to complex questions. The system also integrates a continuous feedback mechanism that allows users to provide remarks and corrections, enabling the model to improve iteratively over time.

## Features
Facebook BART-base Backbone
Utilizes BART for high-quality generative text capabilities.

Reflective Answering Pipeline
Supports detailed and contextually rich answers.

Continuous Feedback Loop
Collects user feedback and suggested improvements to refine model outputs.

Preprocessing Module
Includes preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare input data.

Modular Codebase
Organized into reusable components for preprocessing, training, and inference.
