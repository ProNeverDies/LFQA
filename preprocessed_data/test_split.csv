"[ aes-details ] why is advanced ENCRYPTION standard ( AES ) considered a secure reliable symmetric CIPHER , how doe it function ?","AES is a symmetric block CIPHER standardized by nist and widely adopted for protecting sensitive and classified data . it operates on 128-bit block and support key size of 128 , 192 , or 256 bit , undergoing 10 , 12 , or 14 round of ENCRYPTION , respectively . round involves substitution , permutation , mixing , and key addition step , making brute-force and cryptanalytic attack extremely difficult . AES s flexibility , speed , and resistance to known attack have made it the global standard for commercial and government applications56 ."
"[ malware-maliciousmacros ] why are malicious macro still effective in modern attack , what can organization do to mitigate risk ?","malicious macro , often embedded in office document , remain effective exploit user trust and social engineering , prompting victim to enable macro for legitimate-seeming reason . attacker use OBFUSCATION and living-off-the-land technique to bypass detection . organization can mitigate risk by disabling macro by default , using email filter to block suspicious attachment , training user to recognize phishing attempt , and leveraging endpoint security solution scan macro behavior ."
